Motivation: We noticed that there are a lot of underutilized stuff such as textbooks, notebooks, clothes, portable air conditioners, and daily supplies among NUS students, especially when a semester starts or ends. While these things may be useful to other students if students can trade them with people in need. In order to solve these problems, we would like to create a website which facilitates students to buy, rent, or sell stuff to other students in NUS.

### 4. Development Process
We wrote the website using html and css through self-learning. We first decided the basic elements in the website: the title, logo, search bar, classification and pictures of the goods. After adding the essential elements, we designed the outlook of the website, and wrote the css format accordingly. There was a problem that we couldn't keep two elements in the same line, then we researched online and found out the method to arrange the elements better.
Up till now we have accomplished most of our website and we are working on the back-end of the website to deal with the goods details as well as upload some goods for testing. We added the rolling advertisement part to the website.
By the end of Milestone 3, we finished the design of the website and built the database.
